        Celebrities have some of the most far-reaching platforms on social media. So when George Floyd died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, people hoped that famous figures would use their resources to raise awareness about the Black Lives Matter movement, donate money, and set an example for others.  

        And while some celebrities, like Ariana Grande, Halsey, and Kendrick Sampson, have attended the Black Lives Matter protests across the country and leveraged their platforms to address racial inequality in America, others have not. 
        
        David Guetta, for example, remixed a version of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech in a "tone-deaf" tribute to Floyd. And Madonna contributed a video of her son dancing to Michael Jackson's song "They Don't Really Care About Us" to "honor" Floyd and his family. 
        
        Insider listed 17 celebrities who have been criticized for their words and behavior in the midst of the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests. 
        
        
        Lil Wayne said that disgruntled people should blame themselves for injustices.

        The rapper faced backlash after saying that people should blame themselves for police brutality rather than police or other races. 
        
        "I think we also have to understand that we have to get very specific. We have to get so specific. What I mean by that â€” we have to stop viewing it with such a broad view, meaning we have to stop placing the blame on the whole force and everybody of a certain race, everybody with a badge," he said during an Instagram Live with Fat Joe on May 28. 
        
        Wayne continued, "We have to actually get into who that person is, and if we want to place the blame on anybody, it should be ourselves for not doing more than what we think we're doing."
        
        The "Lollipop" rapper stated that while some people "think they did something" by tweeting or wearing a shirt about the Black Lives Matter movement, it's more important to "learn about it more."
        
        "What we need to do is learn about it more. If we want to scream about something, know what we screaming about. We want to protest something, know what we protesting about," he said, adding, "There's a bunch of facts that we think we know that we don't know."
        
        While some people supported Wayne's desire to learn more about the issues, many criticized him for insinuating that black people were at fault for police brutality instead of looking more deeply at systemic racism.
