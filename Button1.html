        “Color” discrimination is discrimination based on a person’s skin color.  Color is defined by the courts and the federal government as pigmentation, complexion, or skin shade or tone.  Skin color can be, but it not necessarily, a characteristic of race.  Color discrimination includes discrimination based on the lightness, darkness or other color characteristic of a person.  For that reason a person of a particular race who is dark skinned can allege “color” discrimination against a person of the same race who is light skinned.  Because the color of their skin is different, the employee can assert a discrimination claim.

Race discrimination and color discrimination can exist between persons of different races and ethnicity, as well as between persons of the same race and ethnicity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Race discrimination means treating an employee poorly because of their race, while color discrimination means treating an employee poorly because of the color of their skin.

The two categories can overlap. While race and color are not the same, the same discrimination law protects against race and color discrimination. Both forms of discrimination violate the law.
